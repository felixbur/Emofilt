<emotion val="neutral">Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.

Good-day, little red-cap,

said he.

Thank you kindly, wolf.

Whither away so early, little red-cap?

To my grandmother's.

What have you got in your apron?

Cake and wine.  

Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her strong.
