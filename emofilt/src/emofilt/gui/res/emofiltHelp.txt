emoFilt is NOT a text-to-speech synthesizer, it's ONLY a filter between an MBROLA
pho-file and the MBROLA-engine to "emotionalize" the speech.
In order for the acoustic ouput to work, you have to specify the path to your 
Mbrola installation in the config-file. 
Also, if you want the "new utterance" functionality to work, you have to specify a 
grapheme-to-phoneme program in the config-file.
Alternatively you can load an existing pho-file via the utterance.load-menu-item.
Help is provided mainly by tooltips, which should pop up if 
you linger with the pointer over the panels.
